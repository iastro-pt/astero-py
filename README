This is AsteroPy v1.0.0

To install, unzip it in a folder called "astero" (somewhere in your PYTHONPATH)
and then do
>>> import astero

Note: this package depends on the *matplotlib*, *numpy*, *scipy* and
*uncertainties* packages, so make sure you have them installed beforehand.

Usage:

To read frequencies from a file with a format like
    l   n   nu  err
    ... ... ... ...

do the following

>>> sun = astero.load('filename.txt', 5, name='Sun')

The number 5 is a tag that specifies the format of the file. There are other
possibilities, see help for the astero.load function.

Then we can start working with the 'sun' object.

sun.mx  -> frequency 'matrix' with every n for l=0,1,2,3
sun.delta_nu()  -> calculate Delta_nu by fit to radial modes
sun.dnu  -> value of Delta_nu
sun.echelle()  -> plot the echelle diagram

sun.large_sep()
sun.small_sep()
...
